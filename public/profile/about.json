    "about": " I am a Master's student in Autonomy & Robotics at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I learn and apply cutting-edge techniques and technologies in machine learning, artificial intelligence, drones, robotics, and IOT. I am passionate about solving real-world problems and creating innovative solutions that can improve lives and environments. \nPreviously, I was a Research and Development intern at Rucha Yantra LLP, a company that designs and develops autonomous systems for various domains and applications. I work with a team of engineers and researchers to develop and test algorithms and models for computer vision, navigation, and control of aerial and ground robots. I also use Raspberry Pi, and Jetson Nano to implement and optimize the performance of the systems. I have contributed to multiple projects, such as a Autonomous Welding Machine based on computer vision, AGV, drones and robotic arms.\nI have a strong academic background and a proven track record of achievements in robotics and related fields. I graduated with a B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from Shri Ramdeobaba College of Engineering and Management, where I was a student member of the Robotics Club and the Technical Club, and participated in various competitions and events. I also secured the third position in the NASA Space Settlement Contest in 2014, and the First position in the Drone Challenges. ",
