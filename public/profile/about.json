    "about": " I recently graduated (Dec '24) with a Masterâ€™s degree in Autonomy & Robotics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My expertise lies in robotics, computer vision, and automation, with a strong passion for developing autonomous systems that solve real-world problems. \nCurrently, as a Robotics Engineer in Prof. Sunoj Shajahan's lab at UIUC, I am working on developing autonomous navigation and an automatic weeding solution for the AMIGA robot, designed for agricultural applications. My work involves developing a vision-based navigation system for lane following using depth cameras & sensors. Additionally, I am working on building a vision-based weeding mechanism based on DDS between Jetson and Raspberry Pi, integrating multiple motors to precisely identify and eliminate weeds in agricultural fields. \nPreviously, as part of my Professional Practicum with Kohler, I worked on developing an AI-driven automated inspection system for defect detection in manufacturing. My contributions included exploring LiDAR, point clouds, and depth cameras for defect detection and leveraging Basler cameras to build a real-time vision-based inspection system, significantly improving defect identification speed, accuracy, and consistency. I also applied computer vision and GANs to create synthetic datasets for detecting glaze defects in ceramics, leading to a proof-of-concept system that integrated machine learning models for improved quality control. \nI also hold Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My achievements include securing 3rd place in the NASA Space Settlement Contest (2014) and winning multiple drone and robotics challenges. With a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience in robotics, hardware, and autonomous systems, I am eager to contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of robotics and automation.
