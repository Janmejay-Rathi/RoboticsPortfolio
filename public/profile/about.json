    "about": " As a recent graduate with a Master's in Autonomy & Robotics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Dec'24), I am currently working as a Robotics Engineer at Prof. Sunoj Shajahan's Digital Precision Agriculture Lab, alongside Prof. John Reid at UIUC. My work involves developing and integrating key components like vision-based autonomous navigation, safety features, and an autonomous vision-based mechanical weeding system, all aimed at advancing agricultural technology. These systems are being tested and optimized on the AMIGA platform for real-world agricultural applications. \nPreviously, I have worked at Rucha Yantra LLP as a Robotic R&D Intern, where I gained hands-on experience working with Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and other vision-based automation project. My contributions spanned developing algorithms for computer vision, navigation, and control systems, as well as implementing solutions using hardware like Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson and other sensors. \nI hold a B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from Shri Ramdeobaba College of Engineering and Management, where I was an actively involved in the Robotics and Technical Clubs. I also secured third place in the NASA Space Settlement Contest in 2014 and first place in Drone Challenges. \nI am currently open to full-time job opportunities in robotics and autonomy, and I am eager to leverage my skills and experience to contribute to innovative projects in the field. Passionate about solving real-world problems, I am excited to work alongside industry experts to create impactful solutions that push the boundaries of robotics and autonomous systems. ",
